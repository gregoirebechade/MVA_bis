\XSIM{solution-body}{exercise-1=={The methodology we used was the following: We plotted spectrograms of the signals to observe that the signal were characterized by two frequencies band aligned. There were also a time-varying frequency band that we wanted avoid. We decided to detect the 3 most important frequencies at each time step and sort them by increasing order. We then averaged them to have the "mean most important frequency". A Dynp algo was then launched on this time series to detect the change points, with the indication of the number of changed points obtained thanks to the length of the symbol sequence. For each portion detected in the signal, we found the two fundamental frequencies as the max 2 values of the histogram of the 3 maximum frequences recorded during this sequences. This procedure enabled to avoid the noise. We the created a dictionary that had as keys the symbols and at values the top and low frequencies of the signals labelled as this symbol. Then, the median value of top and low frequencies was taken, to prevent badly detecetd signals to introduce errors. The test sequences were classified as follows: the spectrogram was plotted to determine the length of the sequence. The frequencies were identified as explained above, and the symbol of the subsequence was determined as the closest in the whole dictionary. \par }||exercise-2=={\begin {itemize} \item Sequence 1: '7', '2', '1', 'C', '9', '9' \item Sequence 2: '1', '\#', '2', '\#' \end {itemize}}||exercise-3=={\begin {figure} \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{q3_a.png}} \centerline {(a) $R=1$} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{q3_b.png}} \centerline {(b) $R=3$} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{q3_c.png}} \centerline {(c) $R=5$} \end {minipage} \caption {The SAGW kernels functions}\label {fig:sagw-kernels} \end {figure} \par R increases the variance of the functions and shifts them to the left.}||exercise-4=={The stations with missing values are ARZAL, BREST-GUIPAVAS, BRIGNOGAN, LANDIVISIAU, LANNAERO, LANVEOC, OUESSANT-STIFF, QUIMPER, ST NAZAIRE-MONTOIR. \par The threshold is equal to 0.74 \par The signal is the least smooth at 2014-01-21 02:00:00 (signal not smooth when smoothness is high). \par The signal is the smoothest at 2014-01-24 23:00:00 (signal smooth when smoothness is low). \par }||exercise-5=={\begin {figure} \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{q5_a.png}} \centerline {(a) Least smooth signal} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{q5_b.png}} \centerline {(b) Smoothest signal} \end {minipage} \vskip 1em \begin {minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{q5_c.png}} \centerline {(c) First available timestamp} \end {minipage} \caption {Classification of nodes into low/medium/high frequency}\label {fig:node-classif} \end {figure}}||exercise-6=={\begin {figure} \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.8\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{example-image-golden}} \end {minipage} \caption {Average temperature.

\XSIM{exercise-body}{exercise-1=={Design a procedure that takes a sound signal as input and outputs the sequence of symbols. To that end, you can use the provided training set. The signals have a varying number of symbols with a varying duration. There is a brief silence between each symbol. \par Describe in 5 to 10 lines your methodology and the calibration procedure (give the hyperparameter values).

We can for instance classify nodes into low/medium/high frequency: \begin {itemize} \item a node is considered low frequency if the scales $m\in \{1,2,3\}$ contain most of the energy, \item a node is considered medium frequency if the scales $m\in \{4,5,6\}$ contain most of the energy, \item a node is considered high frequency if the scales $m\in \{6,7,9\}$ contain most of the energy. \end {itemize} \par \par For both signals from the previous question (smoothest and least smooth) as well as the first available timestamp, apply this procedure and display on the map the result (one colour per class). \par }||exercise-6=={Display the average temperature and for each timestamp, adapt the marker colour to the majority class present in the graph (see notebook for more details).}||exercise-7=={The previous graph $G$ only uses spatial information. To take into account the temporal dynamic, we construct a larger graph $H$ as follows: a node is now \textit {a station at a particular time} and is connected to neighbouring stations (with respect to $G$) and to itself at the previous timestamp and the following timestamp. Notice that the new spatio-temporal graph $H$ is the Cartesian product of the spatial graph $G$ and the temporal graph $G'$ (which is simply a line graph, without loop). \par \begin {itemize} \item Express the Laplacian of $H$ using the Laplacian of $G$ and $G'$ (use Kronecker products). \item Express the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian of $H$ using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian of $G$ and $G'$. \item Compute the wavelet transform of the temperature signal. \item Classify nodes into low/medium/high frequency and display the same figure as in the previous question. \end {itemize}}}
